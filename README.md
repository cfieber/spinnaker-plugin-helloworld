# spinnaker-plugin-helloworld

_**IMPORTANT: This is an incubating project.**_

This repo is serving as a playground for me to iterate on various developer experience use cases for plugins.
Do not use this repository as a reference.

## todo

- [ ] Rewrite gradle files in .kts
- [ ] Stage plugin testkit
- [ ] SpEL function testkit
- [ ] Local dev publish on build (copy to configured dir?)
- [ ] Fix GPR publishing
- [ ] Build & Deploy pipelines on plugin publish (or in Netflix's case, commit)
  * How could we translate this to OSS? ... without Halyard
- [ ] Roll-up not-bad stuff into a `spinnaker-plugin` gradle plugin project
- [ ] SpEL function plugin
- [ ] Multi-service plugin
